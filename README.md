## Getting started

### Backend

Create and activate a python virtual environment and install from `requirements.txt`. For example:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, to start the backend server, run `api/app.py`

### Frontend

Install npm packages, eg:

```shell
cd frontend
npm i
```
To run the frontend use the following command. Make sure the backend is running as well.

```shell
npm run start
```

### pre-commit

CI runs linters on your code and checks will fail if there are any issues. To help identify/fix issues before you push,
you use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks. Ensure you have pre-commit PyPi package installed (it should be
installed already if you've completed backend setup), then run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

From now on, hooks will run _prior_ to committing, if the hooks modify files, you will have to recommit. If you do not
want the hooks to run hooks, you can unselect "Run Git hooks" when committing in an IntelliJ or commit
with `--no-verify` on the command line, or uninstall hooks entirely by running `pre-commit uninstall`.

The first time committing, hooks may take some time to install.

### Deployment to Heroku

TODO (MATT): do we want autopushes to Heroku via CI? this can be setup. In the meantime, manual deployments:

#### First time setup

- [Install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli)
- Run `heroku login`
- Add Heroku as a git remote: `heroku git:remote -a <existing-heroku-project-name>`

#### Deploying

- Run `npm run build` in `./frontend` to build the React frontend
- Run `git push heroku <your current git branch>:master`
  - If your current git branch is `master` already, you can just write `git push heroku master`
  - You can use the following alias in your `.bashrc` to make this operation require less typing: `alias whateveruwant="git push heroku $(git branch --show-current):master"`

#### Using Heroku's database locally

To use the production database locally, set SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI to the Postgres URI which Heroku sets. You can retrieve this by running `heroku config`:

```shell
(.venv) âžœ heroku config
=== bigger-yoshi Config Vars
DATABASE_URL:            postgres://afcocqutbilyft:759235b9bb0e3227b20079ef21fcae83e8a34fe97c12c1b0bc1f733f172ae758@ec2-54-157-79-121.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dd3bpueruqk0s3
...
```
Create a run configuration that sets the aforementioned environment variable to this value and the app should use the production database.
